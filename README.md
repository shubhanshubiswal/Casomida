Recipe suggesting website from available ingredients. HTML code of website along with PHP to connect with MY-SQL database.
Hello Viewer,
to use the features properly, you need to download to Xampp from https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html to run the phpmyadmin and mysql.

As it was basically made for college project less amount of ingredients were implemented.
To use all kinds of ingredients, you can use a ingredients/ recipes api.
Any suggestions/ edits are welcomed !
